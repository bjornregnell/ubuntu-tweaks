## Email

### General tweaks of Thunderbird

* Open Thunderbird
   * If auto-config is triggered press the "Skip this ..." button and press "Cancel" in the configure email dialog
* Select little striped menu to the right and select Preverences and tick "Menu bar"

* Menu -> View -> Layout -> Vertical

* Add AddOn TT Deep Dark

* In addons manager clock "Lnaguages" to the right and search for "Svenska" in the search box and click install on "Svenska Language Pack" and "Swedish "


### Configure Exquilla email


  * Goto "add-ons" in the striped settings menu to the right. Select "Get Addons" and scroll down to the right and click "Browse more addons".

  * Search for Exquilla and "Add" the Addon and click "Restart".

  * Follow the instructions in the Exquilla tab:
    * Enter email address and password for Lucat
    * Click radio button "Login with username and domain" and enter in field "User name" `lucat-id@lu.se`
    * Click next
    * Click "Do autodiscover"; should yield "Success" after some seconds.

 * You should now have a lot of folders from your IMAP account

 * Allow Thunderbird to synch everything in your inbox -- this may an hour or more


### Configure Calendar
